# Science Journal releases

In keeping with Google tradition (most famous in the naming of Android releases), 
Arduino Science Journal will have pre-release codenames based on scientists.


# Arduino Science Journal 

## Margherita Hack release (1.0, 2020.09.07)

* New Arduino-branded User Interface.
* New external hardware support: Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense
* New in-app getting started activity: "Welcome to Science Journal" with contextual information about how to use Arduino Science Journal.

Margherita Hack Knight Grand Cross OMRI (Italian: [marɡeˈriːta ˈ(h)ak]; 12 June 1922 – 29 June 2013) was an Italian astrophysicist and scientific disseminator. 
The asteroid 8558 Hack, discovered in 1995, was named in her honour.

She was full professor of astronomy at the University of Trieste from 1964 to 1° November 1992, when she was placed "out of role" for seniority.
She has been the first Italian woman to administrate the Trieste Astronomical Observatory from 1964 to 1987, bringing it to international fame.
Member of the most prestigious physics and astronomy associations, 
Margherita Hack was also director of the Astronomy Department at the University of Trieste from 1985 to 1991 and from 1994 to 1997. 
She was a member of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei (national member in the class of mathematical physics and natural sciences; 
second category: astronomy, geodesic, geophysics and applications; section A: astronomy and applications). 

She worked at many American and European observatories and was for long time member of working groups of ESA and NASA. 

In Italy, with an intensive promotion work, she obtained the growth of activity of the astronomical community with access to several satellites, 
reaching a notoriety of international level.
She has published several original papers in international journals and several books both of popular science and university level. 
In 1994 she was awarded with the Targa Giuseppe Piazzi for the scientific research, and in 1995 with the Cortina Ulisse Prize for scientific dissemination.
In 1978 Margherita Hack founded the bimonthly magazine L'Astronomia whose first issue came out in November 1979; 
later, together with Corrado Lamberti, she directed the magazine of popular science and astronomy culture Le Stelle.

## Anning release (1.0, 2016.05.20)

* Observe and record on-device sensors
* Organize data into experiments and projects
* Add pictures and notes to experiments and trials
* Graph sonification (for accessibility and fun)
* Connect to bluetooth-enabled Arduino-based sensors

Mary Anning was born in 1799 to a family that supplemented her father's cabinet-making income by
finding and selling fossils.  They lived in Lyme Regis, a region whose shale-and-limestone geography
meant that frequent landslides would expose new fossils regularly.

She took over the family business, expanding from the occasional single bones and fossilized
ammonite shells.  She found the first complete Ichthyosaurus skeleton, and some of the best
early examples of Plesiosaurus and pterosaurs.  She had no formal science education, and
taught herself anatomy and taxonomy by dissecting modern creatures and reading the latest
scientific papers.

The complete fossil skeletons she found, and their obvious anatomic similarities and
differences when compared to modern animals, helped to frame questions around the development of
life on Earth.  She corresponded with many of the day's scientists, including Adam Sedgwick,
a geologist from the University of Cambridge whose students included a young Charles
Darwin.

## Burnell release (1.1, 2016.08.27)

* Release open-source build on GitHub
* Improvements in graph performance.
* Add captions to picture notes
* Audio settings for data sonification

Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell spent her post-graduate years (1965-1969) constructing and using a radio
telescope that spanned four acres.  Analyzing the data from the telescope, she discovered a radio
source that was pulsing once a second with a very regular frequency.  The object was originally
labelled "LGM-1", for "Little Green Man 1".

What Burnell had found was a _pulsar_, a neutron star that is rotating very rapidly, with a radio
beam that is being emitted along a single axis, like a fast-spinning lighthouse.  Because the signal
from a pulsar can act as a precise "clock" far away in the universe, pulsars can be used in several
ways to measure objects and processes far out in space.  In one example, two pulsars in orbit around
each other could be measured to be losing energy at the rate predicted by Einstein's theory of
gravitational waves.

## Cannon release (1.2, 2016.11.16)

* Sensor triggers: Alert, make notes or start and stop recording when specific sensor values are met
* Third-party sensor API
* Delete experiments and projects
* Add barometer

Annie Jump Cannon, born in 1863, produced the Harvard Classification System of stars still in use
today (Ever heard a character in a science fiction show say something like "Sensor readings indicate
the presence of a G-type star"?  G-type, that's Cannon's classification).  She catalogued more than
500,000 stars, and became famous for taking about 20 seconds on average to classify a star from the
pattern of its color spectrum.

As a result of childhood scarlet fever, Cannon was deaf through most of her career, and used
lip-reading to communicate with colleagues.  She said that she used her deafness to her
advantage, silencing the world to concentrate on the patterns in astronomical data.

Cannon's work and support were very important in Cecilia Payne's
[PhD thesis](http://www.amnh.org/explore/resource-collections/cosmic-horizons/profile-cecilia-payne-and-the-composition-of-the-stars/),
which showed for the first time that stars had vast amounts of hydrogen, upsetting the conventional
wisdom that stars and planets had similar chemical compositions.

## "Cannon++" release (1.2.253, 2017.03.08)

* Chromebook support
* Crop data in recordings
* Nougat multiwindow support

## Dresselhaus release (2.0.312, 2017.10.12)

* Brand-new interface for taking notes and documenting science experiments.
* New snapshot feature for capturing individual data points.
* New sensors: linear accelerometer, magnetometer, and compass
* Redesigned gallery for browsing experiments
* (matches UI now available on iOS devices)

As a graduate student at the University of Chicago, Mildred Dresselhaus (1930-2017)
worked in the department headed by Enrico Fermi, the creator of the first
nuclear reactor.  Fermi would walk to the office at exactly the same time every
morning, and Dresselhaus timed leaving her house so she could join him as he
walked and thought out loud.  She gathered much of the materials for her PhD
project, on how superconductors worked in a magnetic field, under the
university's football stands, where the surplus equipment for that reactor
was still available.

In 1960, Dresselhaus moved to MIT's Lincoln Laboratory.  Superconductors
had become a popular and crowded field; she decided to seek out a neglected
topic, and found a fascination with carbon compounds like graphite
(the material in pencil leads).  Lincoln Lab had its own challenges; at one
point, she tried to bring her one-day-old baby to the office with her, but
was turned away, because the infant didn't have security clearance.

Carbon turned out to be much more versatile than anyone expected.  Dresselhaus
and her lab laid the foundations for creating nanotubes (strong, thin structures
that may someday be used to build elevators to space) and graphene (which
may someday lead to leaps in battery storage capacity and circuit
minaturization).  She earned her nickname, "The Queen of Carbon", and
was awarded a Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Obama, and
the Medal of Honor from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
